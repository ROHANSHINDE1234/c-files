A is an given array and B is formed by adding A's that particular i value with i+1 % with 2
we are givem B and need to decide wether A exist or not.
1) First we will take user define input // 09/03/2023
2) Got to know that if % 2 is going to happen then input will be either 0 or 1.
3) Try different combinations of even and odd numbers to find out which 1 & 0 is not possible.
4) Then code accordingly. // 09/03/2023
