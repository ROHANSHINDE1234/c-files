stdio.h -> standard input output library where all printf and scanf library functions are already defined.
Study different types of error messages in the code which helps while debugging bigger problems in programs.

There are 256 characters in c. %d, %f are format specifiers. Logica operators AND OR and NOT.
if(!((a%3)==0)) this gives output as if A is not divisible by 3.
int a;
while(!(a==-1))
{
  scanf("%d",a)
}//user enters a number and if that number is suppose 5 then (a == -1) condition gets false ie 0 but ! sign makes 
//it 1 and user again asks for another number if -1 is entered then conditon becomes true i.e 1 but ! sign makes 
// it 0 and while loop gets terminated.

cyclic exchange
Read a sequence of numbers until a -1 Output the length of longest contiguous increasing sub sequence.

first take the first number check wether it is -1 or not if it is -1 exit the sequence
if it is other than -1 then compare that number with next number and continue the same the while 
simultaneously keeping the count of the length of the string and comparng if length with other 
sequence.

Modbus RS 485 Is Half-Duplex and Indicates Values Using Differences in Voltage. 
Modbus RTU RS485 interface is similar, but different, from RS-232. 
This two-wire, multi-point connection communicates serial data by indicating values 
by sending different voltages across the two wires.

Byte is an immutable value type that represents unsigned integers with values that range from 0 (which is represented by the Byte.
MinValue constant) to 255 (which is represented by the Byte.MaxValue constant).

1 byte equals 4 bits
26-03-2023
Here 
typedef float f32;
f32 means float can store upto 32 bits of memory

typedef double f64;
double can store 64 bits

Decoupling capacitor 
This capacitor needs to be very close to the microcontroller and and it it very useful to block all the ripple voltage
This capacitor needs to be preferably of ceramic type and the capacitor follows the resonance graphs that means the 
though it is a ceramic capacitor the capacito still contains the small amount of internal inductance and resistor
and when these resistors and caacitors are used they show variable resistance according to the frequency applied so
at that point of the graph where peak is minimum choose that capacitor because it varies when different capacitors are used 
of same pacakage.
Flyback convertors are the basics of smps design.

In fly wheel topology the dc signel is transfered and connected to dc signal and the via help of mosfet and energy is transfered 
via transformer voltage is decided via turns ratio.
find the minimum relay restoring time to decide the value needs to be assigned for the ladder for testing the relays.

Modbus communication protocol
01-04-2023
Modbus is a serial communication protocol developed by Modicon published by ModiconÂ® in 1979 for use with its programmable logic controllers (PLCs). 
In simple terms, it is a method used for transmitting information over serial lines between electronic devices. 
The device requesting the information is called the Modbus Client and the devices supplying information are Modbus Servers. 
In a standard Modbus network, there is one Client and up to 247 Servers, each with a unique Server Address from 1 to 247. 
The Client can also write information to the Servers.

Keeping History of changes in software is important.

Overflow: An integer overflow occurs when you attempt to store inside an integer variable a value that 
is larger than the maximum value the variable can hold. The C standard defines this situation as undefined behavior 
(meaning that anything might happen).
