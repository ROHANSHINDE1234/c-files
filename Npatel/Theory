Alogrithm is very important.
Shapes play a important role in understanding the algorithm.

stdio.h -> standard input output library where all printf and scanf library functions are already defined.
Study different types of error messages in the code which helps while debugging bigger problems in programs.

There are 256 characters in c. %d, %f are format specifiers. Logica operators AND OR and NOT.
if(!((a%3)==0)) this gives output as if A is not divisible by 3.
int a;
while(!(a==-1))
{
  scanf("%d",a)
}//user enters a number and if that number is suppose 5 then (a == -1) condition gets false ie 0 but ! sign makes 
//it 1 and user again asks for another number if -1 is entered then conditon becomes true i.e 1 but ! sign makes 
// it 0 and while loop gets terminated.

cyclic exchange
Read a sequence of numbers until a -1 Output the length of longest contiguous increasing sub sequence.

first take the first number check wether it is -1 or not if it is -1 exit the sequence
if it is other than -1 then compare that number with next number and continue the same the while 
simultaneously keeping the count of the length of the string and comparng if length with other 
sequence.
